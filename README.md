# Buildbot for Freifunk Firmware

The [Freifunk Firmware (Berlin)](https://github.com/freifunk/firmware-berlin) is automatically built by the [buildbot](http://firmware.berlin.freifunk.net:8010/).

This repo contains the buildbot config for the master and slaves.

## Slave config
You can add your server easily as a buildbot slave in order to help us build the firmwares.
